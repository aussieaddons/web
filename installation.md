## Manual installation

First step is the grab the [repo ZIP file](http://r.aussieaddons.com/repo.zip).

Download the ZIP file to your Kodi device and install through the menu via:

`System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file`

The Kodi wiki has a [good walk-through guide to installing ZIP files](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files) if you get stuck.


## Installing add-ons

Once the repository ZIP file is installed, you can install the individual add-ons through the Kodi Add-on manager:

`System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Aussie Add-ons -> Select the add-on category -> Select the add-on -> Install`

The Kodi wiki also has a nice guide on [installing add-ons via the Add-on manager](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager).

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
  <h4>Failed to install a dependency error</h4>
  <p>The <b>failed to install a dependency</b> error is caused by Kodi being unable to install a dependency required by our add-ons.</p>
  <p>The issue is usually due to other third party repositories set up in Kodi which are conflicting with Aussie Add-on's add-ons.</p>
  <p>Try disabling or removing any repos such as TVAddons, SuperRepo, Ares and any others you don't specifically require.</p>
